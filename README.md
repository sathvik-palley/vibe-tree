VibeTree is a cross-platform application that enhances your development workflow by enabling parallel development with AI assistance across multiple git worktrees. Work on features simultaneously without context switching. Access from desktop, browser, or mobile devices.

## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run both web and server (recommended)
pnpm dev:all

# Or run services separately:
pnpm dev:server  # Socket server on random 3XXX port
pnpm dev:web     # Web app on :3000
pnpm dev:desktop # Desktop app
```

### Desktop App

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/sahithvibudhi/vibe-tree/releases):

- **macOS**: Download `.dmg` file (supports both Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: Download `.exe` installer
- **Linux**: Download `.AppImage` or `.deb` file

### Web/Mobile Access

1. Start services: `pnpm dev:all`
2. Access locally: http://localhost:3000
3. For mobile/network access:
   - Scan the QR code shown in terminal
   - Or navigate to the network URL (e.g., http://192.168.1.x:3000)

### üê≥ Docker Deployment

Deploy VibeTree on any VM or cloud instance with one command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This automatically builds and runs VibeTree in a Docker container. Perfect for deployment on EC2, Digital Ocean, or any Docker-enabled environment. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions.

**Safari/iOS Requirements:**
- Both services must be running (web on random 3XXX port, server on random 3XXX port)
- Allow firewall connections on both ports if prompted

#### LAN Dev Mode (no pairing)
When opening from a phone on your Wi‚ÄëFi, the web UI loads over LAN and the web app automatically discovers and connects to the socket server via WebSocket. In development, enable LAN WebSocket access without pairing:

```bash
# Allow LAN connections to the WebSocket server in dev (no auth)
ALLOW_INSECURE_NETWORK=1 HOST=0.0.0.0 pnpm dev:server
pnpm dev:web
```

Then open the printed Network URL (e.g., http://192.168.1.x:3000) on your phone. If you still see "Not connected", you can explicitly point the web app at the socket server by creating `apps/web/.env`:

```ini
VITE_WS_URL=ws://192.168.1.x:XXXX  # Replace XXXX with actual server port
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files as needed:

```bash
# apps/web/.env (optional)
VITE_WS_URL=ws://192.168.1.100:XXXX     # For custom socket server (replace XXXX with actual port)
VITE_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project       # Override project path

# apps/server/.env (optional)
PORT=3002                              # Socket server port (optional, uses random port by default)
HOST=0.0.0.0                          # Bind to all interfaces
PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project          # Default project path
# In dev, allow unauthenticated LAN WebSocket connections (use only on trusted networks)
# Any of these enables it:
# ALLOW_INSECURE_NETWORK=1
# ALLOW_INSECURE_LAN=1
# ALLOW_NETWORK_DEV=1
DEFAULT_PROJECTS=/path1,/path2         # Auto-load projects (first becomes default)
```

## Features

- **Parallel Development** - Work on multiple features simultaneously without stashing or switching branches
- **Persistent Terminal Sessions** - Each worktree maintains its own terminal session with full state preservation
- **Claude CLI Integration** - Seamlessly work with Claude in each terminal
- **IDE Integration** - Open any worktree directly in VS Code or Cursor
- **Multi-Project Support** - Work with multiple repositories in tabbed interface
- **Cross-Platform Access** - Desktop app, web browser, and mobile support
- **Dark/Light Mode** - Automatic OS theme detection with manual toggle
- **macOS Native** - Proper traffic light window controls integration

## Roadmap

- [x] Mobile access - Access from your phone via web browser
- [ ] Claude notifications - Get notified when Claude finishes tasks or needs user input
- [ ] PWA offline support - Work offline on mobile devices
